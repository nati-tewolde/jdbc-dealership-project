# Advanced Car Dealership 

## Project Overview

Advanced Car Dealership is a continuation of the Car Dealership Java-based command-line application that manages a dealership’s vehicle inventory. 
Building on the original features, users can now record vehicle sales or leases, capture customer information, automatically calculate pricing and monthly payments, and save all contract details to a file.

## User Stories

- As a salesperson, I want to record vehicle sales, so that pricing, tax, and finance details are automatically calculated.
- As a salesperson, I want to record vehicle leases, so that leasing details are correctly computed.
- As a salesperson, I want all contracts saved to a file, so that dealership transactions are permanently stored.
- As a salesperson, I want to sell or lease a vehicle directly from the menu, so that customer contracts are created and stored automatically.
